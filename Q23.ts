//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

//let car = 'subaru';

//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

//console.log(car == 'subaru')

//• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

//• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
//.1
let car = `subaru`;
console.log(car == `subaru`)
console.log (car == `city`)
//.2
let num: any = 32
console.log(num === 32)
console.log(num === "32")
//3
let person: string = "sonia"
console.log(person == "sonia")
console.log(person == "sadia")
//4 equality check
let fruit1 = "apple";
let fruit2 = "strawberry";
console.log( fruit1!==  fruit2);
console.log( fruit1 === fruit2);

//5Greater than check
console.log( fruit1 < fruit2);
console.log( fruit1 > fruit2);
